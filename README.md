# Landing Page Swipe File

A curated collection of competitor landing pages for reference and inspiration in GeniusPet campaigns.

## Structure

- **advertorial/** - Advertorial-style landing pages (story-driven, editorial format)
- **listicle/** - Listicle-style landing pages (numbered lists, "X reasons why" format)
- **plain-landing-page/** - Traditional product landing pages (hero, features, CTA)

## Naming Convention

Each swipe is stored in a numbered folder:
- `advertorial-swipe-001/`
- `listicle-swipe-001/`
- `plain-landing-page-swipe-001/`

Files are named using simplified URL format (e.g., `petplus-puppypad.html`).

## Usage

All HTML files are self-contained and work offline. Open directly in a browser to view the preserved landing page.
